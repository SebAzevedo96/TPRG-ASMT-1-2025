This Script is a basic "calculator" program used as an excercise for practice with Functional programming, Try/except loops, a mainguard feature, and the basics of programming in python. 

The primary calculation loop was established quickly and without much difficulty, however my chosen topology essentially precluded the implementation of the multi-view functionality. A.I. was used to generate a fairly convoluted work-around, consisting of an additional if/else chunk to configure the display for two distinct view modes. It is likely possible to fold that functionaity into the main loop for a shorter and more elegant script.
